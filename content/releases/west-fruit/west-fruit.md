Our tragic heroes are inside the absolutely oversized fruit department of a shopping mall. The picture is taken by the supermarkets CCTV camera exactly at July the 7th in 2029 at 4 PM, the moment global warming reached the point of no return and temperatures suddenly are cooling down the place from tropical 40 to arctic minus 10 Celsius.

The Pineapples and other fruit drop to the floor and shatters into thousand and quadrillions of pieces like a symphony of crystal 🔮 sounds.

Sad!
