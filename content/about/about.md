## What is behind the name æsthetical Therapy?

Aesthetics is the art of form, philosophy and perception. To me creating artistically has been a way to learn about myself and others, make me understand. This understanding is what I belief is need to fully overcome the bullshit capitalist, bro culture masculinity, technocratic fascism, spiritual and religious fanaticism we are living in. My work, be it writing, singing, music, video, performance, programming and communication is here to help healing ourselves before anger eats us up.
