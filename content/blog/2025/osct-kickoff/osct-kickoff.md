Excited to announce I started working for award-wining dutch art book publishing house "buildingfictions". As UX Designer and developer I am creating a WebXR app in collaboration with French artist Kevin Bray. The project is a hybrid book and monograph that brings Kevin's extraordinary intermedia artworks to life and tell a compelling story about their creative process.

Planned release date: 2025

My focus for this project is to deliver a kick-ass XR Experience with accessibility across all platforms (Web/iOS/Android/Occulus/Apple Vision Pro/Pico).
