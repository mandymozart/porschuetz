tagline: Reacting to How AI Can Help Bridge Cultural Gaps in Music Therapy by Sophia Omarji
---

The article was written by Sophia Omarji, a psychologist researcher and UX designer until recently working at Spotify. Reading it made me reflect deeply on the impact of AI on culture and the importance of our concept of what “culture” is or is supposed to do. While globalization has brought the world "closer" in many ways, it has also led to a reduction in diversity on a macro scale, as cultures increasingly influence and homogenize each other. The prevalence of hegemonic pop music and its widespread normalization exemplifies this trend, a phenomenon heavily critiqued in post-colonial discourse on music.

Interestingly, the referenced research suggests a more optimistic view of AI. It posits that AI has the potential to carefully reflect cultural niches, acting as an impartial interpreter between professionals and their subjects in contexts like music therapy. However, this also raises concerns about treating culture and worldview as digital commodities, effectively "storing" them within recorded artifacts of music.

The term "culture" itself warrants scrutiny. Sama Maani’s “Respektverweigerung: Warum wir fremde Kulturen nicht respektieren sollten. Und die eigene auch nicht.” argues that the concept of culture often serves to highlight and preserve otherness rather than bridge gaps. This stands in contrast to Sophia Omarji’s study, which advocates for finding commonalities. The purpose of music—whether to emphasize differences or discover universal connections—remains a matter of perspective.

For me, music is a ritual—an intimate interaction between performers, audience, instruments, and settings. Incorporating machines and samples into performances has undeniably altered the dynamics, sometimes detrimentally, particularly when these elements are imbued with meta-level considerations or power dynamics. This connects to therapeutic contexts, where authority is inherently conferred upon therapists by their clients, creating a complex interplay of power.

In therapy, we often surrender control of our narrative and inner monologue to the therapist. This dynamic can be seen as a form of domination, albeit one many people willingly embrace. What fascinates me is the way music fosters association and emotion, enabling communication beyond language or logic. Music’s power lies in its ability to be universally understood without explanation. This, as highlighted in the article, is one of the key benefits of AI in music therapy. AI can facilitate such non-verbal communication and emotional resonance, although this point requires further elaboration.

The art world’s obsession with healing also comes into play here. While collective practices like ambient retreats and sound therapy undoubtedly hold promise, they risk veering into pseudoscience or carelessness. That said, if these practices genuinely help people and cause no harm, they are worth exploring. The author’s emphasis on the ethical implications of AI aligns with broader debates about AI, where issues of power dynamics and control are ever-present. While concerns about AI’s energy consumption may fade over time as adoption becomes inevitable, ethical considerations will likely remain at the forefront.

Therapy itself can be viewed as a ritual. This became clear to me through experiences with Freudian therapy and the concepts of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as outlined by David Burns. Philosophy, ritual, discipline, practice, and belief—along with trust in the therapist’s understanding—form the foundation of positive therapeutic outcomes. Spirituality, in this sense, can be seen as humanity’s way of navigating life’s hardships. Trauma is inevitable, but rituals, whether religious or psychological, provide tools to cope. From shamanism to psychotherapy, rituals often incorporate music, a fact that underscores its universality and healing potential. This thread of thought, however, veers away from the AI argument, which I should circle back to for a stronger conclusion… but well, this is an opinion and reaction piece, so it’s what you get.

The author of the article secured a position at Spotify, a company deeply rooted in the "tech bro" ethos. This connection between data, science, psychology, and AI’s potential as a game changer raises questions about whether such advancements drive human creativity or foster dependency.
